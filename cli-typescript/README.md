# MagicDrop 2

Typescript impmentation of the MagicDrop 1.

### Installation

1. cd to `./cli-typescript`
2. create `.env`. reference `.env.example`
3. run `npm run setup`
4. Try the `drop2` or `magicdrop2` command in your terminal.

Note: Currently, the cli only works properly from the cli-typescript directory. Hence, drop2 commands should be ran inside the directory. Future updates will address this.
